# `githubAPI`

**Internal use only. Use [`github`](github) instead.**

The `githubAPI` configuration option is intended to be used together with [`issueBase`](issueBase). It tells ReSpec where to fetch issues from.

See [using GitHub issues in your spec](Referencing-GitHub-issues-in-your-spec) for an example.
