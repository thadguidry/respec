# `a11y`

Lints for accessibility issues using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core): "Axe is an accessibility testing engine for websites and other HTML-based user interfaces".

**Note:** Using this on hosted documents (e.g., on github pages) can slow down the rendering and may make the page unresponsive. Please only enable only the rules you need.

## Example of usage
Basic example, runs all default plugins with a exception of a [few slow ones](https://github.com/w3c/respec/blob/develop/src/core/a11y.js#L12).
``` js
var respecConfig = {
  a11y: true,
};
```

Example with Axe configuration, as per Axe's [configuration options](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/API.md#options-parameter).

``` js
var respecConfig = {
  a11y: {
    runOnly: ['image-alt', 'link-name'],
  },
};
```
Another example: 
``` js
var respecConfig = {
  a11y: {
    // run all rules, except "image-alt" and slow rules (but run "color-contrast")
    rules: {
        "color-contrast": { enabled: true }, // disabled by default, enable it
        "image-alt": { enabled: false },
    },
  },
};
```

### Example output

If the document has accessibility issues, they will show up as ReSpec warnings: 

![Accessibility warnings in ReSpec](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8426945/76140522-73ea3d00-6081-11ea-95bb-6650fe3abbdb.png)

In an actual document, you can expand the details to get more information about each issue along with a link to the specific HTML element causing the issue.
