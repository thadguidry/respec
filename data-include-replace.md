# `data-include-replace`

By default inclusion happens by placing the content inside the including element. At times, you will actually want the element to be replaced by the inclusion. If so, simply set this attribute to any truthy value.

## Example

Pretending that "section.frag" is a `<section>` element, the `<div>` below would be replaced with a `<section>`.

```html "example": "Replace element with data-include with included content."
<div data-include="section.frag" data-include-replace="true">
  <!-- this all gets replaced, including the div. -->
</div>
```
