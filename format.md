# `format`

Tells ReSpec to treat the document as being in a format other than HTML. Supported formats:

<dl>
  <dt>markdown</dt>
  <dd>Interpreted as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)</a>.
</dl>

## Example

```js "example": "Interpret content as Markdown"
var respecConfig = {
  format: "markdown",
};
```
