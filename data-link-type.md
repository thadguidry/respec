# `data-link-type`

Note: This is mostly internal. Prefer [Shorthands Syntax](Shorthands-Guide), as they automatically add this attribute to relevant elements.

The `data-link-type` attribute allows following values:

- `"dfn"`, `"idl"`: See [`data-dfn-type`](data-dfn-type)
- `"biblio"`: Automatically added on bibliographic references through `[[spec]]` syntax.
