# `references`

You can add an explicit `<section id="reference">` in cases where you need to add custom content to the references section of a document.

## Example

```html "example": "List of normative and non-normated citations."
<section id="references">
  <p>Citations are great!</p>
  <!-- normative and informative references will appear below -->
</section>
```
