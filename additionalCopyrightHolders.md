# `additionalCopyrightHolders`

For regular documents, this is used to specify that additional parties hold a copyright jointly with W3C on this document. This is typically used when publishing documents that were developed in cooperation with other friendly standard consortia such as the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/).

The option is simply some text giving the additional copyright holders. For unofficial documents, this string is used to replace the default CC license.

## Example

```js "example": "Add an additional copyright holder."
var respecConfig = {
  additionalCopyrightHolders: "Internet Engineering Task Force",
};
```
