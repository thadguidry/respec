ReSpec uses the `<title>` element to generate the title of your specification. The `<title>` element is left untouched, but its content is used to create a `<h1>` title for the specification. 

### Example

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html>
<title>The Super Duper Spec</title>
<body>
<!-- 
  The title will magically be placed here with other useful stuff 
--> 
<section id="abstract">
</section>
```
