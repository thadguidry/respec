# `conformance`

When present, a section with id `conformance` tells ReSpec to add the standard boilerplate to the document.

The author can add any additional conformance clause(s) which will follow this boilerplate.

This section is required for specifications that contain normative material.

```html "example": "Add the RFC2119 conformance boilerplate, along with custom content."
<section id="conformance">
  <!-- boilerplate will be added here -->
  <p>The specification specific conformance textâ€¦</p>
</section>
```
