# `conformance`

When present, a section with id `conformance` tells ReSpec to add the standard boilerplate to the document:

<samp>

> As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.
>
> The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

</samp>

The author can add any additional conformance clause(s) which will follow this boilerplate.

This section is required for specifications that contain normative material.

```html "example": "Add the RFC2119 conformance boilerplate, along with custom content."
<section id="conformance">
  <!-- boilerplate will be added here -->
  <p>The specification specific conformance textâ€¦</p>
</section>
```
