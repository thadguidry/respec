# `darkMode`

Enables dark mode support (disabled by default).

```js "example": "Enable dark mode styles"
var respecConfig = {
  darkMode: true,
};
```

**Note:** This is supported for W3C specs only, and makes use of [official dark.css in tr-design](https://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/2021/README.html#dark). The forced color scheme mode toggle is also supported. See [#3236](https://github.com/w3c/respec/pull/3236) for details.
