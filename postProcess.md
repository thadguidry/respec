# `postProcess`

Takes an array of JavaScript functions. The functions are invoked in the order after ReSpec has processed the HTML source. The functionâ€™s signature includes a reference to the config object (i.e., the initial configuration object in the ReSpec source, plus some additional internal data) and the reference to the DOM Document element. As ReSpec includes jQuery, the \$ variable, bound to a jQuery instance, is available within each function.

**Note:** We strongly discourage the use of jQuery. We are trying to eliminate it from ReSpec and encourage people to stop using it entirely. In modern browsers, jQuery is no longer a necessary for cross-browser interoperability. Additionally, modern DOM APIs are now good enough that jQuery should not be needed for manipulating or traversing DOM Nodes.

The following examples shows two functions run in order after processing.

```js "example": "Run two functions in order after processing."
function doThing(config, document){...}
function doOtherThing(config, document){...}

var respecConfig = {
  // After processing, run the following
  postProcess: [doThing, doOtherThing]
}
```
