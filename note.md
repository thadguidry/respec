# `note`

Marks the contents of an element as a "Note". If the element is a 'block' element (e.g., div or p) then the Note will be generate in a block that includes a Note "header" and the contents of the element as the text of the note. If the element also has a title attribute, the content of the title will be appended to the header (e.g., "Note: This is my note").

Note that the content of the `title` attribute will be interpreted as HTML markup. See [`title` attributes](title-attributes) for details.

## Example

```html "example": "Treat given paragraph as a note."
<p class="note" title="Always rely upon native semantics">
  Remember - if you are using the <code>role</code> attribute to say that a
  paragraph is a button, you are probably doing it wrong!
</p>
```

Would be exported as:

<samp>

```html
<div class="note">
  <div class="note-title">
    <span>Note: Always rely upon native semantics</span>
  </div>
  <p>
    Remember - if you are using the <code>role</code> attribute to say that a
    paragraph is a button, you are probably doing it wrong!
  </p>
</div>
```
