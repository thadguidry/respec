# `preProcess`

Expects an array of JavaScript functions. ReSpec invokes these functions in order before any other processing on the HTML occurs. The function’s signature includes a reference to the config object (i.e., the initial configuration object in the ReSpec source, plus some additional internal data) and the reference to the DOM Document element. As ReSpec includes jQuery, the $ variable, bound to a jQuery instance, is available from the global scope (i.e., window.$).

**Note:** We strongly discourage the use of jQuery. We are trying to eliminate it from ReSpec and encourage people to stop using it entirely. In modern browsers, jQuery is no longer a necessary for cross-browser interoperability. Additionally, modern DOM APIs are now good enough that jQuery should not be needed for manipulating or traversing DOM Nodes.

```js "example": "Run two functions in order before processing."
function doThing(config, document){...}
function doOtherThing(config, document){...}

var respecConfig = {
  // Before processing, run the following
  preProcess: [doThing, doOtherThing]
}
```
