# `data-format`

The `data-format` attribute allows sections, or other block-level elements, of your spec to be treated as markdown. It takes only one value: "markdown". Other formats may be supported in the future.

## Example of usage

The following would generate a H2 element (which ReSpec would automatically number).

```markdown
<section data-format="markdown">
 ## This is level 2

 This is a paragraph with some `code`.
</section>
```
