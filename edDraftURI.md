# `edDraftURI`

The URL of the Editor's Draft, used in the header. This is required for  when [specStatus](specStatus) is "ED".

Note: it is strongly recommended that you don't publish Editor's drafts, and instead auto-publish your specification using the [W3C's Echidna workflow](https://github.com/w3c/echidna).  

## Example 

```JS
{
  "specStatus": "ED",
  "edDraftURI": "http://www.w3.org/TR/example",
}
```
