# `ednote`

Marks the contents of an element as an "Editor's Note". If the element is a 'block' element (e.g., div or p) then the Editor's Note will be emitted in a block that includes an Editor's Note "header" and the contents of the element as the text of the note. If the element also has a title attribute, the content of the title will be appended to the header (e.g., "Editor's Note: This is my note").

Note that the content of the `title` attribute will be interpreted as HTML markup. See [`title` attributes](title-attributes) for details.

## Example

```html "example": "An Editor's note."
<p class="ednote" title="This section will be reformatted">
  We are aware that the formatting of this section isn't great. We will fix it
  in the next revision!
</p>
```

Would be emitted as:

<samp>

```html
<div class="ednote">
  <div class="ednote-title">
    <span>Editor's Note: This section will be reformatted</span>
  </div>
  <p>
    We are aware that the formatting of this section isn't great. We will fix it
    in the next revision!
  </p>
</div>
```

</samp>
