# `gh-contributors`

Add an element with `id="gh-contributors"` to show a list of people who have contributed to the GitHub repository.

The list is sorted by names (or GitHub username).

## Example

```html
<section>
  <h2>Contributors</h2>
  <ul id="gh-contributors">
    <!-- list of contributors will appear here,
         along with link to their GitHub profiles -->
  </ul>
</section>
```

```html
<p id="gh-contributors">
  <!-- names of contributors will appear here as comma-separated values -->
</p>
```
