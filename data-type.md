# `data-type`

Usable on `<var>` to [declare a variable's type](giving-variables-data-types). `|variable:type|` is a shorthand for `<var data-type="type">variable</var>`.

Note: The `|variable:type|` syntax accepts fewer characters than the HTML syntax, so, for example, a variable typed as `"valid" or "invalid"` will need to use the HTML syntax.
