Marks a section as being an appendix (which will be numbered with letters). Note that this does not make it informative as some appendices can contain normative material.

It is important to know that every section following an appendix will also be made to be an appendix. 

### Example

```
<section class=appendix>
  <h2>Acknowledgements<h2>
  <p>This spec would not be possible without...
</section>
```
