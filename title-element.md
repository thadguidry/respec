# `<title>`

ReSpec uses the `<title>` element to generate the title of your specification. The `<title>` element is left untouched, but its content is used to create a `<h1>` title for the specification.


```html "example": "Specify a title for current document."
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <title>The Super Duper Spec</title>
  <body>
    <!-- The title will magically be placed here with other useful stuff -->
    <section id="abstract"></section>
  </body>
</html>
```
