# `highlightVars`

With long algorithms in a specification, it can be useful to allow readers to click on variables marked up with `<var>` (e.g., Let `<var>elem</var> be ...`). By setting the `respecConfig.highlightVars` configuration option, readers can now click on `vars` in an algorithm to see where they are used.

## Example of usage

```js "example": "Enable variable highlighting"
var respecConfig = {
  highlightVars: true,
};
```

## Example Output

It renders as:
