## `data-dfn-type` attribute
We use the same [acceptable values](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#dfn-types) as BikeShed. 

Generally, you don't need to this attribute, as it defaults to `dfn`. However, you are free to override it as needed, especially for anything being [`data-export`](data-export)ed.
