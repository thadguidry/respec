# `prevED`

Sometimes it happens that a document is moved in the version control system, passed from one group to another, or split into several smaller documents. In such cases since the version control information is harder to find, this option can be used to point to a previous Editor's Draft. Rarely used.

## Example

```js
var respecConfig = {
  prevED: "https://example.com/old/ed",
}
```
