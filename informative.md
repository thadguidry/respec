# `informative`

Used for regular sections or appendices that are not meant to contain normative material. It will automatically preface its content with the well-known “This section is non-normative” paragraph.

## Examples

```html "example": "Mark a section as non-normative."
<section class="informative">
  <h2>A bit of history!</h2>
  <p>A really cool thing is that ...</p>
</section>
```
