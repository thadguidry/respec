Used for regular sections or appendices that are not meant to contain normative material. It will automatically preface its content with the well-known “This section is non-normative” paragraph. 

### Examples
```HTML
<section class=informative>
  <h2>A bit of history!</h2>
  <p>A really cool thing is that ... 
</section>
```
